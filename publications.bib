   abstract = {While individual starch types may not possess the ideal gelatinization and retrogradation properties for specific applications, the amalgamation of multiple starch varieties might bestow desirable physicochemical properties upon resulting starch-based products. This study explored the impact of incorporating purple rice starch (PRS), as a novel starch variant (up to 15 % PRS), on the gelatinization and retrogradation (within 14 days) of regular wheat starch (WS). Rheological and texture assessments demonstrated that the introduction of PRS diminished the viscoelasticity and hardness of fresh WS paste. Additionally, in the case of retrograded WS pastes stored at 4 °C for 1–14 days, the incorporation of 10 % or 15 % PRS effectively retarded the reduction in transparency and significantly reduced hardness, retrogradation degree, the ratio of absorbance at 1047/1017 cm−1, and relative crystallinity. Notably, 10 % PRS results in a more pronounced effect. Conversely, 5 % PRS induced an opposing impact on retrograded WS post-storage. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy revealed that as the proportion of PRS increased, the microstructure of gelatinized WS-PRS closely resembled that of pure PRS. In conclusion, the diverse effects of varying PRS proportions on WS alter the texture and characteristics of starch-based foods, underscoring the potential of starch blending for improved applications.},

   journal = {Carbohydrate Polymers},
   volume = {339},
   pages = {122247},
   abstract = {The escalating demand for environmentally sustainable and cost-effective adhesives in the wood processing and manufacturing sector has prompted exploration into innovative solutions. This study introduces a novel gel adhesive composed of chemically unmodified high-amylose starch (G70, with 68 % amylose content) with a minimal proportion of urea-formaldehyde (UF) (UF/starch = 1:10, w/w). This G70/UF gel demonstrates remarkable adhesive capabilities for wooden boards under both dry conditions (with a shear stress of 4.13 ± 0.12 MPa) and wet conditions (with a shear strength of 0.93 ± 0.07 MPa after 2 h of water soaking). The study unveils that the elevated amylose content in the starch, coupled with a meticulously controlled isothermal process during bonding, is crucial for these enhancements. Specifically, the robust cohesion of amylose chains expedites phase separation between starch and UF, while the isothermal process facilitates the migration and enrichment of UF molecules at the gel-board and gel-air interfaces. Lacking these mechanisms, conventional amylopectin-rich starch/UF gels (27 % amylose content) show minimal improvement. Moreover, the G70/UF gel showcases exceptional fire retardancy. In all, the G70/UF gel presents a promising alternative for plywood production, reducing reliance on unhealthy UF resin while offering satisfactory bonding resistance in diverse conditions and superior flame retardancy.},

   abstract = {In light of escalating biomedical demands across diverse diseases, there arises a pressing need for the development of sophisticated biocompatible materials exhibiting augmented biological functionality. Chitosan, a cationic polyelectrolyte copolymer of natural origin, distinguishes itself through its extraordinary biological properties, positioning it as a promising starting material to develop versatile biomedical materials. Tremendous attention has been directed towards the creation of high-performance biocomposites, achieved through the strategic manipulation of chitosan’s structure or its derivative, along with the amalgamation of other biopolymers. This comprehensive review intricately explores recent advancements in chitosan-based biofunctional materials, delving into formulations involving various biopolymers including polysaccharides and proteins. It places specific emphasis on the progress in chitosan chemistry and materials development, encompassing particles, hydrogels, aerogels, membranes, films, and sponges. Also, this review critically evaluates the development and functional properties of biofunctional chitosan–biopolymer composite materials, spotlighting interactions, both dynamic covalent and noncovalent, and their pivotal roles in materials formation. These interactions may either be inherent or realized through chemical modification such as “Click” chemistry, polymer grafts, mussel-inspired chemistry, and selective oxidation. Furthermore, the text illustrates the current and potential biomedical applications of these biofunctional composite materials, spanning from wound dressing to tissue engineering (skin, bone, cartilage, and nerve), the controlled release and targeted delivery of drugs/bioactive compounds, biosensing, and 3D printing. Additionally, it addresses critical challenges within the field, posits potential solutions, and provides a forward-looking perspective on the future directions of functional biomaterials and design strategies.},

   journal = {Advances in Colloid and Interface Science},
   volume = {325},
   pages = {103113},
   abstract = {Gels derived from single networks of natural polymers (biopolymers) typically exhibit limited physical properties and thus have seen constrained applications in areas like food and medicine. In contrast, gels founded on a synergy of multiple biopolymers, specifically polysaccharides and proteins, with intricate interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structures, represent a promising avenue for the creation of novel gel materials with significantly enhanced properties and combined advantages. This review begins with the scrutiny of newly devised IPN gels formed through a medley of polysaccharides and/or proteins, alongside an introduction of their practical applications in the realm of food, medicine, and environmentally friendly solutions. Finally, based on the fact that the IPN gelation process and mechanism are driven by different inducing factors entwined with a diverse amalgamation of polysaccharides and proteins, our survey underscores the potency of physical, chemical, and enzymatic triggers in orchestrating the construction of crosslinked networks within these biomacromolecules. In these mixed systems, each specific inducer aligns with distinct polysaccharides and proteins, culminating in the generation of semi-IPN or fully-IPN gels through the intricate interpenetration between single networks and polymer chains or between two networks, respectively. The resultant IPN gels stand as paragons of excellence, characterized by their homogeneity, dense network structures, superior textural properties (e.g., hardness, elasticity, adhesion, cohesion, and chewability), outstanding water-holding capacity, and heightened thermal stability, along with guaranteed biosafety (e.g., nontoxicity and biocompatibility) and biodegradability. Therefore, a judicious selection of polymer combinations allows for the development of IPN gels with customized functional properties, adept at meeting precise application requirements.},

This issue may be addressed by nanoencapsulation through electrospinning. In this study, octenylsuccinylated starch (OSS) with different molecular structures blended with pullulan (PUL) was developed to load CEO for enhanced antibacterial potential. OSS with a smaller molecular size and a higher degree of substitution is beneficial for the electrospinning of OSS/PUL into high-quality nanofiber mats. The electrospinning process of OSS/PUL aqueous dopes is mainly influenced by moderate apparent viscosity, increased conductivity, and reduced surface tension. CEO loading through physical adsorption significantly changed the fiber microstructure and displayed antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus flavus for electrospun OSS/PUL nanofiber mats. This study demonstrates that electrospun starch-based nanofiber mats with loading of essential oils could hold a potential application in active food packaging and wound dressing.},

   journal = {International Journal of Biological Macromolecules},
   volume = {264},
   pages = {130772},
   abstract = {This investigation stems from the wide interest in mitigating starch retrogradation, which profoundly impacts the quality of starch-based food, garnering significant attention in the contemporary food industry. Our study delves into the intricate dynamics of soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) and soybean oil (SO) when added individually or in combination to native corn starch (NCS), offering insights into the gelatinization and retrogradation phenomena. We observed that SSPS (0.5 %, w/w) hindered starch swelling, leading to an elevated gelatinization enthalpy change (∆H) value, while SO (0.5 %, w/w) increased ∆H due to its hydrophobicity. Adding SSPS and/or SO concurrently reduced the viscosity and storage modulus (G′) of starch matrix. For the starch gel (8 %, w/v) after refrigeration, SSPS magnified water-holding capacity (WHC) and decreased hardness through hydrogen bonding with starch, while SO increased hardness with limited water retention. Crucially, the combination of SSPS and SO maximized WHC, minimized hardness, and significantly inhibited starch retrogradation. The specific ratio of SSPS to SO was found to significantly influence the starch properties, with a 1:1 ratio resulting in the most desirable quality for application in starch-based foods. This study offers insights for utilizing polysaccharides and lipids in starch-based food products to extend shelf life.},

   abstract = {Curcumin is a naturally occurring hydrophobic polyphenolic compound with a rapid metabolism, poor absorption, and low stability, which severely limits its bioavailability. Here, we employed a starch–protein-based nanoparticle approach to improve the curcumin bioavailability. This study focused on synthesizing nanoparticles with a zein “core” and a carboxymethylated short-chain amylose (CSA) “shell” through anti-solvent precipitation for delivering curcumin. The zein@CSA core–shell nanoparticles were extensively characterized for physicochemical properties, structural integrity, ionic stability, in vitro digestibility, and antioxidant activity. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicates nanoparticle formation through hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions between zein and CSA. Zein@CSA core–shell nanoparticles exhibited enhanced stability in NaCl solution. At a zein-to-CSA ratio of 1:1.25, only 15.7% curcumin was released after 90 min of gastric digestion, and 66% was released in the intestine after 240 min, demonstrating a notable sustained release effect. Furthermore, these nanoparticles increased the scavenging capacity of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) free radical compared to those composed solely of zein and were essentially nontoxic to Caco-2 cells. This research offers valuable insights into curcumin encapsulation and delivery using zein@CSA core–shell nanoparticles.},

   abstract = {Background A range of bio-based, biodegradable, and edible straw options have emerged as eco-friendly alternatives to combat plastic straw pollution. These innovative solutions utilize materials such as polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose, and seaweed) and polylactic acid (PLA). Despite their positive environmental impact, these alternatives face challenges and limitations compared to traditional, durable plastic straws. Consequently, extensive research is underway to bolster their performance and refine manufacturing technology. Scope and approach This comprehensive review delves into recent strides in bio-based biodegradable straw development. It covers the spectrum from raw materials to manufacturing methods, including rolling-up, screw extrusion, directional diffusion assembly, and drill method. The exploration extends to targeted enhancement techniques, such as the creation of fiber composites and the development of hydrophobic coatings or surfaces. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the challenges faced by biodegradable straws, touching on nanotoxicity, raw material sourcing, cost, and degradation efficiency, adds depth to the analysis. Key findings and conclusions While existing processing methods cater to the preparation of biomass straws, a pressing concern is the lack of comprehensive and standardized evaluation criteria for biodegradability/composability. This gap contributes to confusion in assessing these alternatives. Addressing this issue emerges as a crucial step forward. This review emphasizes that breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies will heighten the market competitiveness of various biodegradable straw types. The conclusive insights and perspectives offer the aim to steer the design and fabrication of eco-friendly food tableware and packaging.},

   abstract = {While the extensive utilization of disposable plastic straws has resulted in significant environmental issues such as microplastics and soil and ocean pollution, the quest for alternative straws for versatile use remains a formidable challenge. Here, drawing inspiration from naturally water-resistant materials such as bones and sea urchins, we have developed seaweed-based straws with significantly improved water resistance and mechanical strength via in-situ mineralization of CaCO3 on their surfaces. Specifically, the COO− groups on the G (α-L-guluronate) blocks of alginate were employed to establish a robust cross-linked network, while the COO− groups on the M (β-D-mannuronate) blocks attracted free Ca2+ through electrostatic forces, thereby promoting CaCO3 nucleation. This effectively prevents COOH groups from hydrating, reducing swelling, and results in the fabrication of nano- to micron-sized CaCO3 particles that reinforce the structure without compromising the cross-linked network. Compared with the control group, the S5% sample (prepared with 5 % Na2CO3 solution) exhibited a 102 % increase in water contact angle, a 35 % decrease in swelling degree, and a 35.5 % and 37.5 % increase in ultimate flexural and tensile stress, respectively. Furthermore, the potential use of these straws as a waste for heavy metal adsorption was investigated, addressing environmental concerns while demonstrating economic feasibility.},

   abstract = {Abstract The inclusion of tungsten disulphide nanotubes (WS2 NTs) in chitosan, plasticized with glycerol, facilitates the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex. The glycerol interrupts the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between chitosan chains allowing positively charged protonated amines of chitosan to form a complex with negatively charged oxygen ions chemisorbed to the tungsten atoms in defects. These interactions, with the unique mechanical and chemical properties of WS2 NTs, result in a chitosan film with superior properties relative to unfilled chitosan. Even at low WS2 NT loadings (≤1 wt%), the Young's modulus (E) increases by 59%, tensile strength (σ) by 40% and tensile toughness by 74%, compared to neat chitosan, without sacrificing ductility. Addition of highly dispersed WS2 NTs significantly improves the gas barrier properties of chitosan, with a 50% reduction in oxygen permeability, while the addition of both glycerol and WS2 NTs to chitosan effectively reduces the carbon dioxide permeability by 80% and the water vapor transmission rate by 90%. The intrinsic antimicrobial efficacy of chitosan against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is enhanced on inclusion of WS2 NTs. Polyelectrolyte complexation of WS2 NTs and glycerol-plasticized chitosan provides a cost-effective, sustainable route to biodegradable films with desirable mechanical, gas barrier properties, and antimicrobial efficacy suitable for food packaging applications.},

A combination of micro-differential scanning calorimetry, rheometry and atomic force microscopy were employed to explore the assembly process of KGM and xanthan with varying fine structures. Xanthan possessing standard acetyl (4.57%) and high pyruvate group contents (6.49%)(SA/HP) exhibited type-A and type-B bindings when interacting with KGM through cooling process. Decreasing these group contents effectively reduced type-B binding. Additionally, removal of pyruvate groups to 5.53% amplified type-A binding and gel strength from 258 Pa to 653 Pa, thanks to the improved helical structure forming ability of xanthan. Decreasing acetyl groups also intensified type-A interaction and gel strength from 258 Pa to 872 Pa. This stemmed from the formation of more stable assembly structure of xanthan and KGM, compared to the helical structure of deacetylated xanthan. These findings hold promise for the rational design of KGM/xanthan systems for versatile applications.},

The results showed that adding NaCl or CaCl2 eliminated type-B binding due to an electrostatic shielding effect. Adding NaCl or CaCl2 (3 and 6 mM) enhanced type-A binding by neutralizing the negative charge of COOH and reducing the electrostatic repulsion among xanthan chains, as evidenced by an increase in the onset temperature of exotherm peak, the formation of more parallel multiple filaments, and an increase in aggregation structures (>1.0 nm) and gel hardness. When CaCl2 concentration was higher, Ca2+ bridged side-chain clusters into more complex structures, which would hardly participate in the formation of helical structures and weaken type-A binding.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and chemical force analysis unveiled the profound influence of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions in the formation of the intricate network architecture of SPI/Car gels. Remarkably, λ-carrageenan interacted with the hydrophilic groups on the surface of agglomerated SPI particles, effectively composing the fundamental framework of SPI/Car gels. Simultaneously, λ-carrageenan emerged as a linchpin through hydrogen bonding, establishing pivotal crosslinking connections. The introduction of λ-carrageenan resulted in a reduction in SPI particle size, the dispersion of previously formed aggregates, and a subtle blurring of the SPI particles. It also significantly heightened the prevalence of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, ultimately giving rise to a robust yet somewhat coarse gel structure, as evidenced by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). These profound structural alterations underpinned the enhancement of water-holding capacity (WHC) and gel hardness in SPI/Car gels. These findings hold promise for the rational design and application of SPI-based systems in the production of processed vegetarian and vegan foods.},

   abstract = {Starch-stilbene polyphenol complexes, a novel form of resistant starch (RS), have received considerable attention due to their potential health benefits. To enhance the functionality of this type of complex, we examined the interactions between resveratrol (RA) and high-amylose starch with different molecular weights, achieved through enzymatic modification followed by high-pressure homogenization (HPH). We examined how these interactions affect the digestibility and ordered structures of the complexes. Our findings reveal that, notwithstanding the inhibition of double helix and B-type crystalline structure formation, RA-starch complexation markedly boosted single helix content, V-type crystalline structure formation, and aggregate structure density. These effects contributed notably to increased RS content. Interestingly, the formation of the V6-type crystalline structure within the complexes was primarily facilitated by the CH-π interaction between the aromatic rings of RA and the C–H of starch, rather than conventional hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces. The strength of the CH-π interaction increased with higher amylose content and lower molecular weight of the starch, achievable through a 12-h pullulanase hydrolysis followed by a 2-h α-amylase hydrolysis. The resulting HPH-Pα2-RA complexes exhibited remarkable levels of the V-type crystalline structure and RS content, reaching up to 25.45% and 57.37%, respectively. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the design of starch-polyphenols complexes with a high RS content.},

   abstract = {The burgeoning interest in biopolymer 3D printing arises from its capacity to meticulously engineer tailored, intricate structures, driven by the intrinsic benefits of biopolymers—renewability, chemical functionality, and biosafety. Nevertheless, the accessibility of economical and versatile 3D-printable biopolymer-based inks remains highly constrained. This study introduces an electroconductive ink for direct-ink-writing (DIW) 3D printing, distinguished by its straightforward preparation and commendable printability and material properties. The ink relies on chitosan as a binder, carbon fibers (CF) a low-cost electroactive filler, and silk fibroin (SF) a structural stabilizer. Freeform 3D printing manifests designated patterns of electroconductive strips embedded in an elastomer, actualizing effective strain sensors. The ink's high printability is demonstrated by printing complex geometries with porous, hollow, and overhanging structures without chemical or photoinitiated reactions or support baths. The composite is lightweight (density 0.29 ± 0.01 g/cm3), electroconductive (2.64 ± 0.06 S/cm), and inexpensive (20 USD/kg), with tensile strength of 20.77 ± 0.60 MPa and Young's modulus of 3.92 ± 0.06 GPa. 3D-printed structures exhibited outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of 30–31 dB, with shielding of >99.9 % incident electromagnetic waves, showcasing significant electronic application potential. Thus, this study presents a novel, easily prepared, and highly effective biopolymer-based ink poised to advance the landscape of 3D printing technologies.},

   abstract = {The advantages of physically modifying starch are evident: minimal environmental impact, no by-products, and straightforward control. The impact of dual modification on starch properties is contingent upon modification conditions and starch type. Herein, we subjected purple rice starch (PRS) to heat-moisture treatment (HMT, 110 °C, 4 h) with varying moisture content, ultrasound treatment (UT, 50 Hz, 30 min) with different ultrasonic power, and a combination of HMT and UT. Our findings reveal that UT following HMT dispersed starch granules initially aggregated by HMT and resulted in a rougher granule surface. Rheological analysis showcased a synergistic effect of HMT and UT, enhancing the fluidity of PRS and reinforcing its resistance to deformation in paste form. The absorbance ratio R1047/1015 indicates that increased moisture content during HMT and high ultrasound power for UT reduced the short-range order degree (1.69). However, the combined HMT-UT exhibited an increased R1047/1015 (1.38–1.64) compared to HMT alone (1.29–1.45), likely due to short-chain rearrangement. Notably, the A-type structure of PRS remained unaltered, but overall crystallinity significantly decreased (23.01 %–28.56 %), consistent with DSC results. In summary, physical modifications exerted significant effects on PRS, shedding light on the mechanisms governing the transformation of structural properties during HMT-UT.},

   abstract = {There have been continuous quests for suitable solvents for starch, given the importance of effective starch dissolution in its modification and subsequent materials production. In light of this, the potential of hydroxyl-functionalized ionic liquid (IL) as a promising solvent for starch was investigated. Within this study, a hydroxyl-functionalized IL 1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazole chloride ([Dhpmim][Cl]) was synthesized, and the dissolution of starch in this IL and its aqueous solutions was examined. Starch (5.35 wt%) was completely dissolved in [Dhpmim][Cl] within 2 h at 100 °C. The solubility of starch in [Dhpmim][Cl]-water mixtures initially increased and then decreased with rising water content. The optimal ratio was found to be 1:9 (wt/wt) water:[Dhpmim][Cl], achieving the highest solubility at 9.28 wt%. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations elucidated the possible interactions between starch and solvents. After dissolution and regeneration in the 1:9 water:[Dhpmim][Cl] mixture, starch showed no discernible change in the molecular structure, with no derivatization reaction observed. Regenerated starch exhibited a transformation in crystalline structure from A-type to V-type, and its relative crystallinity (12.4 %) was lower than that of native starch (25.2 %), resulting in decreased thermal stability. This study suggests that the hydroxyl-functionalized IL, [Dhpmim][Cl], and its aqueous solutions serve as effective solvents for starch dissolution.},

   pages = {131315},
   abstract = {Understanding the hierarchical structure and physicochemical properties of starch isolated from fermented dough with different times (0–120 min) is valuable for improving the quality of fermented dough-based products. The results indicate that fermentation disrupted the starch granule surface and decreased the average particle size from 19.72 μm to 18.45 μm. Short-term fermentation (< 60 min) disrupted the crystalline, lamellar, short-range ordered molecular and helical structures of starch, while long-term fermentation (60–120 min) elevated the ordered degree of these structures. For example, relative crystallinity and double helix contents increased from 23.7 % to 26.8 % and 34.4 % to 37.2 %, respectively. During short-term fermentation, the structural amorphization facilitated interactions between starch molecular chains and water molecules, which increased the peak viscosity from 275.4 to 320.6 mPa·s and the swelling power from 7.99 to 8.52 g/g. In contrast, starches extracted from long-term fermented dough displayed the opposite results. Interestingly, the hardness and springiness of starch gels gradually decreased as fermentation time increased. These findings extend our understanding of the starch structure-property relationship during varied fermentation stages, potentially benefiting the production of better-fermented foods.},

   volume = {271},
   pages = {132593},
   abstract = {This study delves into the effects of curdlan integration and thermal sterilization on the rheological properties, structure, and quality attributes of concentrated rice starch gel. Acting as a heat-set polysaccharide, curdlan established a dual-network gel structure with rice starch gel, displaying strong interactions with rice starch, as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The addition of curdlan expedited the gel formation of rice starch, yielding a denser gel structure. Consequently, this enhanced G′, solid-like behavior, textural properties, and cooking quality while reducing frequency-dependence. Given the cooling-induced gelation behavior of pure rice starch, thermal treatment disrupted inter-chain hydrogen bonding, compromising the structural integrity of the gel. This disruption manifested in a softer texture and diminished mechanical properties and cooking quality. Notably, this decline in mechanical properties and cooking quality of rice starch gel was markedly ameliorated with the incorporation of curdlan, particularly at a content of ≥1.0 %. Compared with pure RS, 1.0 % CD inclusion showed a reduction in cooking breakage rate by 30.69 % and an increase in hardness by 38.04 %. This work provides valuable insights for the advancement of fresh starch gel-based foods that exhibit exceptional quality and an extended shelf life.},

Specifically, it scrutinizes the symbiotic interplay between rice starch, a cooling-set gel, and curdlan, a thermo-irreversible heating-set gel. A higher curdlan content enhances the inter-chain hydrogen bonding between rice starch and curdlan, resulting in a denser gel structure and thus increased moduli, solid-like behavior, and mechanical properties, and reduced frequency-dependence, especially at high temperatures (>65 °C). For example, with 50 % curdlan incorporation, G′ (90 °C) improved by 252 %. Notably, thermal treatment can compromise the structural integrity of the rice starch gel, reducing strength and softening texture. However, this textural degradation can be effectively mitigated with, for example, 30 % curdlan incorporation, resulting in a 55-fold hardness increase at 85 °C. The knowledge gained from this work offers valuable guidance for tailoring starch-based gel products to specific properties.},

   abstract = {Hydroxypropyl starch-based composite system has high potential for many applications such as food packaging and biomedical fields. Here, how the incorporation of curdlan, a thermo-irreversible heating-set gel, tailors the processability, structure, and film performance of hydroxypropyl starch, a cooling-set gel, has been systematically investigated, aiming to achieve enhanced material properties favorable for edible packaging applications. Curdlan incorporation increased the shear-thinning behavior and viscosity of hydroxypropyl starch solution, which was also strongly affected by temperature. The miscibility and comparability between the two polymers with distinct gelation behaviors is a practical and interesting scientific topic. Scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis all indicated good compatibility between hydroxypropyl starch and curdlan. There was no observable phase boundary between the two materials, and all composite films showed only a single relaxation peak and only one polymer thermal decomposition peak. This resulted in improved structural density and overall performance. Compared with pure HPS film, the 7:3 HPS/CD film showed increases in tensile strength by 66.12 % and thermal decomposition temperature by 3 °C, and a reduction in water solubility by 11.72 %. This knowledge gained here may facilitate the development of edible films based on hydroxypropyl starch with satisfying film performance and processability.},

   volume = {254},
   pages = {127938},
   abstract = {While high-amylose starch (HAS) possesses advantageous properties such as high resistant starch content and favorable mechanical attributes, its gelatinization constraints have limited its applicability. This study enhances its versatility by focusing on pre-gelatinized (PG) HAS with exceptional rehydratability, achieved by disorganizing native HAS granules (with amylose contents of 55 % and 68 %, respectively) using a 33 % CaCl2 solution, followed by water-ethanol precipitation and freeze-drying. The resulting PG-HAS exhibited elevated amylose content (61 % and 75 %) with minimal changes in amylose molecular weight. PG-HAS displayed superior water-absorption index (WAI) and water-soluble index (WSI) compared to native HAS, further improved by 2 % CaCl2 solution incorporation. Furthermore, composite films were prepared by mixing PG-HAS with PVA at a 6:4 (w/w) ratio. The PG-G50 (61 % amylose content)/PVA composite film exhibited remarkable elongation (131.1 ± 5.4 %), nearly three times that of a normal corn starch (NCS, with 27 % amylose)/PVA film, attributed to improved starch dispersity and higher amylose content. Nonetheless, the PG-G70 (75 % amylose content)/PVA film at the same ratio showed lower elongation (54.7 ± 8.0 %), potentially due to strong cohesive forces between amylose chains that impede starch-PVA interactions. Moreover, the PG-HAS/PVA composite films, enriched with antibacterial agents, demonstrated effective antibacterial properties with a gradual and sustained release of active compounds. Notably, the PG-G50/PVA/tannic acid (TA) film effectively preserved fresh apple slices by inhibiting bacteria growth and preventing browning. These findings underscore the excellent rehydration of PG-HAS and its potential as an inner packaging material for irregularly shaped foods, such as sliced fruits or meats, due to its nontoxic nature, softness and flexibility, which allows the film to maintain close contact with food surfaces.},

   abstract = {The advent of direct-ink-writing 3D printing in food processing highlights potential for innovation but underscores challenges with food-grade inks, notably their inadequate self-supporting properties post-extrusion that impede maintaining structural integrity and crating complex 3D forms. This challenge is particularly pronounced with starch—a key food ingredient. This study aims to bolster the printability of normal corn starch (NCS) through integration with pregelatinized (PG) high-amylose starch (G50 and G70, with 55% and 68% amylose contents, respectively) and proteins (soy, wheat, pea protein isolates, and whey protein). The PG starch was prepared by disorganizing the high-amylose starches in 33% CaCl2 solution and then precipitating them with ethanol. The formulation featuring an NCS/PG-G70/soy protein isolate ratio of 5:5:3 emerged superior, yielding enhanced formability, precise line printing, and robust self-support. This adapted starch-based gel facilitated the 3D printing of sophisticated structures, such as hollow and overhanging architectural forms, without necessitating chemical modification or a support bath. In vitro enzymatic hydrolysis tests on the printed constructs manifested approximately 50% resistant starch and 15% slowly digestible starch. These results suggest that the composite biopolymer ink developed in this study showcases not only superior printability but also boasts improved digestion-resistance. Thus, the findings from this research provide a foundation for developing food-grade inks capable of crafting customizable, intricately structured food products while conferring health advantages.},

   abstract = {In this study, we investigated the effects of one-step and two-step annealing on pea starch (PS) and their impact on the starch structure and oil absorption following frying. Compared to native PS, both one-step and two-step annealing treatments significantly reduced starch solubility, swelling power, oil absorption, and specific surface area while increasing water absorption. The extent of these changes depended on the specific annealing parameters applied. Notably, among all the starch samples, PS-45-55-F (PS subject to two-step annealing at 45 °C and then 55 °C, followed by frying) exhibited the lowest oil absorption. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results revealed that PS-45-F (PS subject to one-step annealing at 45 °C, followed by frying) and PS-45-55-F retained more of the original starch structure after frying. Analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) consistently indicate that two-step annealed starch (PS-45-55-F) better preserved both long-range and short-range ordered structure of starch granules during frying. Additionally, it enhanced the thermostability of annealed starch, making it more effective in inhibiting oil absorption. These findings highlight the potential of two-step annealed starch for the development of low-oil, high-quality, and healthy fried or pre-fried food products, such as coated fried chicken and tempura.},

   abstract = {The excessive water sensitivity of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) films prevent them from being used extensively. In order to overcome this limitation, superhydrophobic HPMC films were meticulously crafted through the utilization of a composite of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and ball-milled rice starch, corn starch, or potato starch (RS/CS/PS) for the coating process. Initially possessing hydrophilic properties, the HPMC Film (CA = 49.3 ± 1.8°) underwent a transformative hydrophobic conversion upon the application of PDMS, resulting in a static contact angle measuring up to 103.4 ± 2.0°. Notably, the synergistic combination of PDMS-coated HPMC with ball-milled starch demonstrated exceptional superhydrophobic attributes. Particularly, the treated HPMC-based film, specifically the HP-CS-2 h film, showcased an impressive contact angle of 170.5° alongside a minimal sliding angle of 5.2°. The impact of diverse starch types and the ball milling treatment on the PDMS/starch coatings and HPMC film was thoroughly examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXS), and particle size analysis. These studies demonstrated that the low surface energy and roughness required for the creation of superhydrophobic HPMC-based films were imparted by the hierarchical structure formed by the application of PDMS/ball-milled starch.

   abstract = {To comprehend the intricate interplay of five common food polysaccharides, κ-Carrageenan (KC), konjac glucomannan (KGM), locust bean gum (LBG), low-acyl gellan gum (LAG), and sodium alginate (SA), within composite polysaccharide gels, widely employed for textural modulation and flavor enhancement. This study systematically modulates the quantities of these five polysaccharides to yield six distinct multi-polysaccharide gels. The unique impact of each polysaccharide on the overall quality of composite gels were studied by thermostability, microstructure, water-holding capacity (WHC), texture, and sensory attributes. The findings unequivocally manifest the phenomenon of thermoreversible gelation in all composite gels, except for the KC-devoid sample, which displayed an inability to solidify. Notably, KGM, LBG, and LAG emerged as pivotal enhancers of the network structure in these composite gels, while SA was identified as a promotor of layered structure, resulting in a reduction of surface hardness. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA) to analyzed 14 critical evaluation parameters of the five multi-polysaccharide gels, revealing the order as follows: KC > KGM > SA > LAG > LBG. These findings would imparts valuable insights into the pragmatic utilization of multi-polysaccharide gels for the development of food products (e.g. Bobo balls in milk tea) with tailored textural and sensory attributes.},

AFM results showed that the height and width of gluten molecular chains were decreased after calendering and increased post-cooking. Calendering reduced the molecular size and compacted the gluten network (increased Dm). The SDS extractable gluten components showed a quasi-spherical chain conformation but gradually changed to a random coil conformation due to heating. According to SEC-MALLS profiles, calendering and appropriate heating (4 min) promoted the homogeneity of molecular mass of glutenin polymer. The mechanical depolymerization and the heat-promoted polymerization of gluten could be due to the breakage and formation of disulfide bonds and the interconversion of sulfhydryl groups.},

   volume = {270},
   pages = {132421},
   abstract = {This study examines the effects of flaxseed gum (FG) on the aggregate structure, pasting and rheological properties of waxy rice starch (WRS). Results display an increase in the ordered molecular structure (R1047/1024), relative crystallinity (RC), compactness (α), and microphase heterogeneity (ε, density degree of nanoaggregates, from 3.52 to 4.23) for WRS-FG complexes. These suggested FG facilitated the development of more organized molecular and crystalline structures of WRS, accompanied by the formation of ordered nanoaggregates with higher density (i.e., nano-aggregation structure). Also, FG addition resulted in the formation of enhanced gel network structure characterized by thicker layer walls and more uniform pores. These structural transformations contributed to a rise in gelatinization temperature (To, from 56.90 °C to 62.10 °C) and enthalpy (ΔH), as well as alterations in paste viscosities (PV, from 1285.00 mPa·s to 1734.00 mPa·s), and the rigidity of network structure (e.g., decreased loss tangent). These results indicate that FG could effectively regulate the techno-functional properties of WRS by rationally controlling the starch intrinsic structures of starch. And this study may improve the pasting and gelling properties of starch, thus driving the development of high-quality starchy foods and prolonging their shelf life, especially for glutinous rice flour products.},

   abstract = {Abstract Background Modified polysaccharides have greatly expanded applications in comparison with native polysaccharides due to their improved compatibility and interactions with proteins and active compounds in food-related areas. Nonetheless, there is a noticeable dearth of research concerning the utilization of carboxymethyl starch (CMS) as a microcapsule wall material in food processing, despite its common use in pharmaceutical delivery. The development of an economical and safe embedding carrier using CMS and gelatin (GE) holds immense importance within the food-processing industry. In this work, the potential of innovative coacervates formed by the combination of GE and CMS as a reliable, stable, and biodegradable embedding carrier is evaluated by turbidity measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and rheological measurements. Results The results indicate that GE-CMS coacervates primarily resulted from electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The optimal coacervation was observed at pH?4.6 and with a GE/CMS blend ratio of 3:1 (w/w). However, the addition of NaCl reduced coacervation and made it less sensitive to temperature changes (35?55?°C). In comparison with individual GE or CMS, the coacervates exhibited higher thermal stability, as shown by TGA. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the GE-CMS coacervates maintained an amorphous structure. Rheological testing reveals that the GE-CMS coacervates exhibited shear-thinning behavior and gel-like properties. Conclusion Overall, attaining electroneutrality in the mixture boosts the formation of a denser structure and enhances rheological properties, leading to promising applications in food, biomaterials, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. ? 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.},

   abstract = {Polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels are widely used in wide-ranging applications in biology, medicine, pharmaceuticals and environmental sectors. However, achieving the requisite mechanical properties, fatigue resistance, self-recovery, biocompatibility, and biodegradability remains a challenge. Herein, we present a facile method to construct a nanocomposite hydrogel by integrating short linear glucan (SLG), obtained by debranching waxy corn starch, into a PAM network through self-assembly. The resulting composite hydrogel with 10 % SLG content exhibited satisfactory stretchability (withstanding over 1200 % strain), along with maximum compressive and shear strengths of about 490 kPa and 39 kPa at 90 % deformation, respectively. The hydrogel demonstrated remarkable resilience and could endure repeated compression and stretching. Notably, the nanocomposite hydrogel with 10 % SLG content exhibited full stress recovery at 90 % compression deformation after 20 s, without requiring specific environmental conditions, achieving an energy dissipation recovery rate of 98 %. Meanwhile, these hydrogels exhibited strong adhesion to various soft and hard substrates, including skin, glasses and metals. Furthermore, they maintain solid integrity at both 37 °C and 50 °C after swelling equilibrium, unlike traditional PAM hydrogels, which exhibited softening under similar conditions. We hope that this PAM-SLG hydrogel will open up new avenues for the development of multifunctional electronic devices, offering enhanced performance and versatility.},
