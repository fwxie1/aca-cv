abstract: The process of dissolving cellulose is a pivotal step in transforming it
  into functional, value-added materials, necessitating a thorough comprehension of
  the underlying mechanisms to refine its advanced processing. This article reviews
  cellulose dissolution using various solvent systems, along with an in-depth exploration
  of the associated dissolution mechanisms. The efficacy of different solvents, including
  aqueous solvents, organic solvents, ionic liquids, hybrid ionic liquid/cosolvent
  systems, and deep eutectic solvents, in dissolving cellulose is scrutinized, and
  their limitations and advantages are highlighted. In addition, this review methodically
  outlines the mechanisms at play within these various solvent systems and the factors
  influencing cellulose solubility. Conclusions drawn highlight the integral roles
  of the degree of polymerization, crystallinity, particle size, the type and sizes
  of cations and anions, alkyl chain length, ionic liquid/cosolvent ratio, viscosity,
  solvent acidity, basicity, and hydrophobic interactions in the dissolution process.
  This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for researchers investigating
  biopolymer dissolution in a broader context, thereby paving the way for broader
  applications and innovations of these solvent systems.
