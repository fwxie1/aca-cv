abstract: In light of escalating biomedical demands across diverse diseases, there
  arises a pressing need for the development of sophisticated biocompatible materials
  exhibiting augmented biological functionality. Chitosan, a cationic polyelectrolyte
  copolymer of natural origin, distinguishes itself through its extraordinary biological
  properties, positioning it as a promising starting material to develop versatile
  biomedical materials. Tremendous attention has been directed towards the creation
  of high-performance biocomposites, achieved through the strategic manipulation of
  chitosan’s structure or its derivative, along with the amalgamation of other biopolymers.
  This comprehensive review intricately explores recent advancements in chitosan-based
  biofunctional materials, delving into formulations involving various biopolymers
  including polysaccharides and proteins. It places specific emphasis on the progress
  in chitosan chemistry and materials development, encompassing particles, hydrogels,
  aerogels, membranes, films, and sponges. Also, this review critically evaluates
  the development and functional properties of biofunctional chitosan–biopolymer composite
  materials, spotlighting interactions, both dynamic covalent and noncovalent, and
  their pivotal roles in materials formation. These interactions may either be inherent
  or realized through chemical modification such as “Click” chemistry, polymer grafts,
  mussel-inspired chemistry, and selective oxidation. Furthermore, the text illustrates
  the current and potential biomedical applications of these biofunctional composite
  materials, spanning from wound dressing to tissue engineering (skin, bone, cartilage,
  and nerve), the controlled release and targeted delivery of drugs/bioactive compounds,
  biosensing, and 3D printing. Additionally, it addresses critical challenges within
  the field, posits potential solutions, and provides a forward-looking perspective
  on the future directions of functional biomaterials and design strategies.
