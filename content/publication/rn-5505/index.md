abstract: The escalating demand for environmentally sustainable and cost-effective
  adhesives in the wood processing and manufacturing sector has prompted exploration
  into innovative solutions. This study introduces a novel gel adhesive composed of
  chemically unmodified high-amylose starch (G70, with 68 % amylose content) with
  a minimal proportion of urea-formaldehyde (UF) (UF/starch = 1:10, w/w). This G70/UF
  gel demonstrates remarkable adhesive capabilities for wooden boards under both dry
  conditions (with a shear stress of 4.13 ± 0.12 MPa) and wet conditions (with a shear
  strength of 0.93 ± 0.07 MPa after 2 h of water soaking). The study unveils that
  the elevated amylose content in the starch, coupled with a meticulously controlled
  isothermal process during bonding, is crucial for these enhancements. Specifically,
  the robust cohesion of amylose chains expedites phase separation between starch
  and UF, while the isothermal process facilitates the migration and enrichment of
  UF molecules at the gel-board and gel-air interfaces. Lacking these mechanisms,
  conventional amylopectin-rich starch/UF gels (27 % amylose content) show minimal
  improvement. Moreover, the G70/UF gel showcases exceptional fire retardancy. In
  all, the G70/UF gel presents a promising alternative for plywood production, reducing
  reliance on unhealthy UF resin while offering satisfactory bonding resistance in
  diverse conditions and superior flame retardancy.
