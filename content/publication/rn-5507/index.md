abstract: This study examines the effects of flaxseed gum (FG) on the aggregate structure,
  pasting and rheological properties of waxy rice starch (WRS). Results display an
  increase in the ordered molecular structure (R1047/1024), relative crystallinity
  (RC), compactness (α), and microphase heterogeneity (ε, density degree of nanoaggregates,
  from 3.52 to 4.23) for WRS-FG complexes. These suggested FG facilitated the development
  of more organized molecular and crystalline structures of WRS, accompanied by the
  formation of ordered nanoaggregates with higher density (i.e., nano-aggregation
  structure). Also, FG addition resulted in the formation of enhanced gel network
  structure characterized by thicker layer walls and more uniform pores. These structural
  transformations contributed to a rise in gelatinization temperature (To, from 56.90 °C
  to 62.10 °C) and enthalpy (ΔH), as well as alterations in paste viscosities (PV,
  from 1285.00 mPa·s to 1734.00 mPa·s), and the rigidity of network structure (e.g.,
  decreased loss tangent). These results indicate that FG could effectively regulate
  the techno-functional properties of WRS by rationally controlling the starch intrinsic
  structures of starch. And this study may improve the pasting and gelling properties
  of starch, thus driving the development of high-quality starchy foods and prolonging
  their shelf life, especially for glutinous rice flour products.
