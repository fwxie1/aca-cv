 abstract = {This study examines the effects of flaxseed gum (FG) on the aggregate structure, pasting and rheological properties of waxy rice starch (WRS). Results display an increase in the ordered molecular structure (R1047/1024), relative crystallinity (RC), compactness (α), and microphase heterogeneity (ε, density degree of nanoaggregates, from 3.52 to 4.23) for WRS-FG complexes. These suggested FG facilitated the development of more organized molecular and crystalline structures of WRS, accompanied by the formation of ordered nanoaggregates with higher density (i.e., nano-aggregation structure). Also, FG addition resulted in the formation of enhanced gel network structure characterized by thicker layer walls and more uniform pores. These structural transformations contributed to a rise in gelatinization temperature (To, from 56.90 °C to 62.10 °C) and enthalpy (ΔH), as well as alterations in paste viscosities (PV, from 1285.00 mPa·s to 1734.00 mPa·s), and the rigidity of network structure (e.g., decreased loss tangent). These results indicate that FG could effectively regulate the techno-functional properties of WRS by rationally controlling the starch intrinsic structures of starch. And this study may improve the pasting and gelling properties of starch, thus driving the development of high-quality starchy foods and prolonging their shelf life, especially for glutinous rice flour products.},
