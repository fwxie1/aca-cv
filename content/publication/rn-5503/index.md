abstract: Alginate, a polymer mainly derived from seaweed, has garnered significant
  attention owing to its renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and exceptional
  gel formation characteristics, rendering it highly versatile for numerous applications.
  Recognizing the imperative for tailored bulk materials, this review scrutinizes
  the processing methodologies of alginate-based bulk materials and delineates strategies
  to improve their properties, encompassing ionic crosslinking, plasticization, and
  hybridization with other polymers and/or fillers. It explores noteworthy alginate-based
  blends with natural polymers like polysaccharides and proteins, alongside fossil-based
  polymers like poly(vinyl alcohol). It also examines alginate-based composites incorporating
  various nanofillers such as cellulose nanoparticles, graphene, and nanoclays. The
  processing techniques for these multiphase alginate-based systems encompass solution
  casting, coating, spinning, 3D printing, and thermomechanical processing. Strategies
  for crosslinking alginate, plasticizing it, and optimizing its interactions with
  other polymers/fillers are outlined, bearing repercussions on the resultant materials
  properties. This review emphasizes the structure–process–property relationships
  of these multiphase systems in bulk and highlights synergistic effects and potential
  impediments to property improvements. It surveys prospective applications for alginate-based
  multiphasic bulk materials, spanning membrane separation, controlled release, wound
  healing, tissue engineering, food packaging, and agricultural domains. Finally in
  this field, knowledge gaps have been identified and future research directions are
  suggested.
