abstract: In this study, we investigated the effects of one-step and two-step annealing
  on pea starch (PS) and their impact on the starch structure and oil absorption following
  frying. Compared to native PS, both one-step and two-step annealing treatments significantly
  reduced starch solubility, swelling power, oil absorption, and specific surface
  area while increasing water absorption. The extent of these changes depended on
  the specific annealing parameters applied. Notably, among all the starch samples,
  PS-45-55-F (PS subject to two-step annealing at 45 °C and then 55 °C, followed by
  frying) exhibited the lowest oil absorption. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
  results revealed that PS-45-F (PS subject to one-step annealing at 45 °C, followed
  by frying) and PS-45-55-F retained more of the original starch structure after frying.
  Analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared
  (FT-IR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) consistently indicate that
  two-step annealed starch (PS-45-55-F) better preserved both long-range and short-range
  ordered structure of starch granules during frying. Additionally, it enhanced the
  thermostability of annealed starch, making it more effective in inhibiting oil absorption.
  These findings highlight the potential of two-step annealed starch for the development
  of low-oil, high-quality, and healthy fried or pre-fried food products, such as
  coated fried chicken and tempura.
