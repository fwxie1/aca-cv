 abstract = {This study delves into the effects of curdlan integration and thermal sterilization on the rheological properties, structure, and quality attributes of concentrated rice starch gel. Acting as a heat-set polysaccharide, curdlan established a dual-network gel structure with rice starch gel, displaying strong interactions with rice starch, as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The addition of curdlan expedited the gel formation of rice starch, yielding a denser gel structure. Consequently, this enhanced G′, solid-like behavior, textural properties, and cooking quality while reducing frequency-dependence. Given the cooling-induced gelation behavior of pure rice starch, thermal treatment disrupted inter-chain hydrogen bonding, compromising the structural integrity of the gel. This disruption manifested in a softer texture and diminished mechanical properties and cooking quality. Notably, this decline in mechanical properties and cooking quality of rice starch gel was markedly ameliorated with the incorporation of curdlan, particularly at a content of ≥1.0 %. Compared with pure RS, 1.0 % CD inclusion showed a reduction in cooking breakage rate by 30.69 % and an increase in hardness by 38.04 %. This work provides valuable insights for the advancement of fresh starch gel-based foods that exhibit exceptional quality and an extended shelf life.},
