abstract: The advent of direct-ink-writing 3D printing in food processing highlights
  potential for innovation but underscores challenges with food-grade inks, notably
  their inadequate self-supporting properties post-extrusion that impede maintaining
  structural integrity and crating complex 3D forms. This challenge is particularly
  pronounced with starchâ€”a key food ingredient. This study aims to bolster the printability
  of normal corn starch (NCS) through integration with pregelatinized (PG) high-amylose
  starch (G50 and G70, with 55% and 68% amylose contents, respectively) and proteins
  (soy, wheat, pea protein isolates, and whey protein). The PG starch was prepared
  by disorganizing the high-amylose starches in 33% CaCl2 solution and then precipitating
  them with ethanol. The formulation featuring an NCS/PG-G70/soy protein isolate ratio
  of 5:5:3 emerged superior, yielding enhanced formability, precise line printing,
  and robust self-support. This adapted starch-based gel facilitated the 3D printing
  of sophisticated structures, such as hollow and overhanging architectural forms,
  without necessitating chemical modification or a support bath. In vitro enzymatic
  hydrolysis tests on the printed constructs manifested approximately 50% resistant
  starch and 15% slowly digestible starch. These results suggest that the composite
  biopolymer ink developed in this study showcases not only superior printability
  but also boasts improved digestion-resistance. Thus, the findings from this research
  provide a foundation for developing food-grade inks capable of crafting customizable,
  intricately structured food products while conferring health advantages.
