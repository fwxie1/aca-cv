abstract: Abstract Background Modified polysaccharides have greatly expanded applications
  in comparison with native polysaccharides due to their improved compatibility and
  interactions with proteins and active compounds in food-related areas. Nonetheless,
  there is a noticeable dearth of research concerning the utilization of carboxymethyl
  starch (CMS) as a microcapsule wall material in food processing, despite its common
  use in pharmaceutical delivery. The development of an economical and safe embedding
  carrier using CMS and gelatin (GE) holds immense importance within the food-processing
  industry. In this work, the potential of innovative coacervates formed by the combination
  of GE and CMS as a reliable, stable, and biodegradable embedding carrier is evaluated
  by turbidity measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
  Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and rheological measurements. Results
  The results indicate that GE-CMS coacervates primarily resulted from electrostatic
  interactions and hydrogen bonding. The optimal coacervation was observed at pH?4.6
  and with a GE/CMS blend ratio of 3:1 (w/w). However, the addition of NaCl reduced
  coacervation and made it less sensitive to temperature changes (35?55?Â°C). In comparison
  with individual GE or CMS, the coacervates exhibited higher thermal stability, as
  shown by TGA. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the GE-CMS coacervates maintained
  an amorphous structure. Rheological testing reveals that the GE-CMS coacervates
  exhibited shear-thinning behavior and gel-like properties. Conclusion Overall, attaining
  electroneutrality in the mixture boosts the formation of a denser structure and
  enhances rheological properties, leading to promising applications in food, biomaterials,
  cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. ? 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.
