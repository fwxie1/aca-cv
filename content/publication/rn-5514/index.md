abstract: Curcumin is a naturally occurring hydrophobic polyphenolic compound with
  a rapid metabolism, poor absorption, and low stability, which severely limits its
  bioavailability. Here, we employed a starch–protein-based nanoparticle approach
  to improve the curcumin bioavailability. This study focused on synthesizing nanoparticles
  with a zein “core” and a carboxymethylated short-chain amylose (CSA) “shell” through
  anti-solvent precipitation for delivering curcumin. The zein@CSA core–shell nanoparticles
  were extensively characterized for physicochemical properties, structural integrity,
  ionic stability, in vitro digestibility, and antioxidant activity. Fourier-transform
  infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicates nanoparticle formation through hydrogen-bonding,
  hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions between zein and CSA. Zein@CSA core–shell
  nanoparticles exhibited enhanced stability in NaCl solution. At a zein-to-CSA ratio
  of 1:1.25, only 15.7% curcumin was released after 90 min of gastric digestion, and
  66% was released in the intestine after 240 min, demonstrating a notable sustained
  release effect. Furthermore, these nanoparticles increased the scavenging capacity
  of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) free radical compared to those composed
  solely of zein and were essentially nontoxic to Caco-2 cells. This research offers
  valuable insights into curcumin encapsulation and delivery using zein@CSA core–shell
  nanoparticles.
