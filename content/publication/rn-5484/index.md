abstract: Gels derived from single networks of natural polymers (biopolymers) typically
  exhibit limited physical properties and thus have seen constrained applications
  in areas like food and medicine. In contrast, gels founded on a synergy of multiple
  biopolymers, specifically polysaccharides and proteins, with intricate interpenetrating
  polymer network (IPN) structures, represent a promising avenue for the creation
  of novel gel materials with significantly enhanced properties and combined advantages.
  This review begins with the scrutiny of newly devised IPN gels formed through a
  medley of polysaccharides and/or proteins, alongside an introduction of their practical
  applications in the realm of food, medicine, and environmentally friendly solutions.
  Finally, based on the fact that the IPN gelation process and mechanism are driven
  by different inducing factors entwined with a diverse amalgamation of polysaccharides
  and proteins, our survey underscores the potency of physical, chemical, and enzymatic
  triggers in orchestrating the construction of crosslinked networks within these
  biomacromolecules. In these mixed systems, each specific inducer aligns with distinct
  polysaccharides and proteins, culminating in the generation of semi-IPN or fully-IPN
  gels through the intricate interpenetration between single networks and polymer
  chains or between two networks, respectively. The resultant IPN gels stand as paragons
  of excellence, characterized by their homogeneity, dense network structures, superior
  textural properties (e.g., hardness, elasticity, adhesion, cohesion, and chewability),
  outstanding water-holding capacity, and heightened thermal stability, along with
  guaranteed biosafety (e.g., nontoxicity and biocompatibility) and biodegradability.
  Therefore, a judicious selection of polymer combinations allows for the development
  of IPN gels with customized functional properties, adept at meeting precise application
  requirements.
