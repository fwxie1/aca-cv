abstract: This chapter will give an overview of different aspects of knowledge and
  progress in the processing of polysaccharides including starch, chitosan, alginate,
  and cellulose, which show properties and processibility very different from those
  of traditional synthetic polymers. They are important renewable resources to produce
  biodegradable and functional materials to meet specific application needs and to
  address sustainability issues. This chapter will first introduce the fundamental
  characteristics and modification strategies of these different polysaccharides,
  particularly related to processing. Then, strategies to formulate polysaccharide-based
  materials and composites will be discussed. Following that, different techniques
  for the processing of polysaccharides will be highlighted, such as solution-based
  methods, thermomechanical processing (with limited solvents), electrospinning, and
  3D printing. Finally, challenges and future perspectives in this area will be given.
