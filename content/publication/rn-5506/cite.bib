 abstract = {This chapter will give an overview of different aspects of knowledge and progress in the processing of polysaccharides including starch, chitosan, alginate, and cellulose, which show properties and processibility very different from those of traditional synthetic polymers. They are important renewable resources to produce biodegradable and functional materials to meet specific application needs and to address sustainability issues. This chapter will first introduce the fundamental characteristics and modification strategies of these different polysaccharides, particularly related to processing. Then, strategies to formulate polysaccharide-based materials and composites will be discussed. Following that, different techniques for the processing of polysaccharides will be highlighted, such as solution-based methods, thermomechanical processing (with limited solvents), electrospinning, and 3D printing. Finally, challenges and future perspectives in this area will be given.},
