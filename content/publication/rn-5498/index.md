abstract: Understanding the hierarchical structure and physicochemical properties
  of starch isolated from fermented dough with different times (0–120 min) is valuable
  for improving the quality of fermented dough-based products. The results indicate
  that fermentation disrupted the starch granule surface and decreased the average
  particle size from 19.72 μm to 18.45 μm. Short-term fermentation (< 60 min) disrupted
  the crystalline, lamellar, short-range ordered molecular and helical structures
  of starch, while long-term fermentation (60–120 min) elevated the ordered degree
  of these structures. For example, relative crystallinity and double helix contents
  increased from 23.7 % to 26.8 % and 34.4 % to 37.2 %, respectively. During short-term
  fermentation, the structural amorphization facilitated interactions between starch
  molecular chains and water molecules, which increased the peak viscosity from 275.4
  to 320.6 mPa·s and the swelling power from 7.99 to 8.52 g/g. In contrast, starches
  extracted from long-term fermented dough displayed the opposite results. Interestingly,
  the hardness and springiness of starch gels gradually decreased as fermentation
  time increased. These findings extend our understanding of the starch structure-property
  relationship during varied fermentation stages, potentially benefiting the production
  of better-fermented foods.
