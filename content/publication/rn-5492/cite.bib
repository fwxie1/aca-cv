 abstract = {The advantages of physically modifying starch are evident: minimal environmental impact, no by-products, and straightforward control. The impact of dual modification on starch properties is contingent upon modification conditions and starch type. Herein, we subjected purple rice starch (PRS) to heat-moisture treatment (HMT, 110 °C, 4 h) with varying moisture content, ultrasound treatment (UT, 50 Hz, 30 min) with different ultrasonic power, and a combination of HMT and UT. Our findings reveal that UT following HMT dispersed starch granules initially aggregated by HMT and resulted in a rougher granule surface. Rheological analysis showcased a synergistic effect of HMT and UT, enhancing the fluidity of PRS and reinforcing its resistance to deformation in paste form. The absorbance ratio R1047/1015 indicates that increased moisture content during HMT and high ultrasound power for UT reduced the short-range order degree (1.69). However, the combined HMT-UT exhibited an increased R1047/1015 (1.38–1.64) compared to HMT alone (1.29–1.45), likely due to short-chain rearrangement. Notably, the A-type structure of PRS remained unaltered, but overall crystallinity significantly decreased (23.01 %–28.56 %), consistent with DSC results. In summary, physical modifications exerted significant effects on PRS, shedding light on the mechanisms governing the transformation of structural properties during HMT-UT.},
