 abstract = {There have been continuous quests for suitable solvents for starch, given the importance of effective starch dissolution in its modification and subsequent materials production. In light of this, the potential of hydroxyl-functionalized ionic liquid (IL) as a promising solvent for starch was investigated. Within this study, a hydroxyl-functionalized IL 1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazole chloride ([Dhpmim][Cl]) was synthesized, and the dissolution of starch in this IL and its aqueous solutions was examined. Starch (5.35 wt%) was completely dissolved in [Dhpmim][Cl] within 2 h at 100 °C. The solubility of starch in [Dhpmim][Cl]-water mixtures initially increased and then decreased with rising water content. The optimal ratio was found to be 1:9 (wt/wt) water:[Dhpmim][Cl], achieving the highest solubility at 9.28 wt%. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations elucidated the possible interactions between starch and solvents. After dissolution and regeneration in the 1:9 water:[Dhpmim][Cl] mixture, starch showed no discernible change in the molecular structure, with no derivatization reaction observed. Regenerated starch exhibited a transformation in crystalline structure from A-type to V-type, and its relative crystallinity (12.4 %) was lower than that of native starch (25.2 %), resulting in decreased thermal stability. This study suggests that the hydroxyl-functionalized IL, [Dhpmim][Cl], and its aqueous solutions serve as effective solvents for starch dissolution.},
