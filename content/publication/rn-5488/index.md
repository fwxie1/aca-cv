abstract: There have been continuous quests for suitable solvents for starch, given
  the importance of effective starch dissolution in its modification and subsequent
  materials production. In light of this, the potential of hydroxyl-functionalized
  ionic liquid (IL) as a promising solvent for starch was investigated. Within this
  study, a hydroxyl-functionalized IL 1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazole chloride
  ([Dhpmim][Cl]) was synthesized, and the dissolution of starch in this IL and its
  aqueous solutions was examined. Starch (5.35 wt%) was completely dissolved in [Dhpmim][Cl]
  within 2 h at 100 °C. The solubility of starch in [Dhpmim][Cl]-water mixtures initially
  increased and then decreased with rising water content. The optimal ratio was found
  to be 1:9 (wt/wt) water:[Dhpmim][Cl], achieving the highest solubility at 9.28 wt%.
  Density functional theory (DFT) simulations elucidated the possible interactions
  between starch and solvents. After dissolution and regeneration in the 1:9 water:[Dhpmim][Cl]
  mixture, starch showed no discernible change in the molecular structure, with no
  derivatization reaction observed. Regenerated starch exhibited a transformation
  in crystalline structure from A-type to V-type, and its relative crystallinity (12.4 %)
  was lower than that of native starch (25.2 %), resulting in decreased thermal stability.
  This study suggests that the hydroxyl-functionalized IL, [Dhpmim][Cl], and its aqueous
  solutions serve as effective solvents for starch dissolution.
