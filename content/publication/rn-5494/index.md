abstract: Synergistic interaction gels could be formed by synergistic type-A and type-B
  bindings between konjac glucomannan (KGM) and xanthan during cooling. Adding salt
  ions significantly altered those bindings and thus the gel-related properties. The
  results showed that adding NaCl or CaCl2 eliminated type-B binding due to an electrostatic
  shielding effect. Adding NaCl or CaCl2 (3 and 6 mM) enhanced type-A binding by neutralizing
  the negative charge of COOH and reducing the electrostatic repulsion among xanthan
  chains, as evidenced by an increase in the onset temperature of exotherm peak, the
  formation of more parallel multiple filaments, and an increase in aggregation structures
  (>1.0 nm) and gel hardness. When CaCl2 concentration was higher, Ca2+ bridged side-chain
  clusters into more complex structures, which would hardly participate in the formation
  of helical structures and weaken type-A binding. The results obtained are beneficial
  for the rational design and preparation of KGM/xanthan gels with synergistic interaction.
