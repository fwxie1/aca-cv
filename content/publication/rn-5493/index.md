abstract: This work explored the pivotal role of λ-carrageenan in fortifying the gel
  structure, consequently enhancing gel-related attributes within an acid-induced
  soy protein isolate/λ-carrageenan system (SPI/Car). The model system was prepared
  by subjecting a thermally treated mixture of these two biopolymers to acidification.
  Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and chemical force analysis unveiled the profound
  influence of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions in the formation of
  the intricate network architecture of SPI/Car gels. Remarkably, λ-carrageenan interacted
  with the hydrophilic groups on the surface of agglomerated SPI particles, effectively
  composing the fundamental framework of SPI/Car gels. Simultaneously, λ-carrageenan
  emerged as a linchpin through hydrogen bonding, establishing pivotal crosslinking
  connections. The introduction of λ-carrageenan resulted in a reduction in SPI particle
  size, the dispersion of previously formed aggregates, and a subtle blurring of the
  SPI particles. It also significantly heightened the prevalence of hydrogen bonding
  and electrostatic interactions, ultimately giving rise to a robust yet somewhat
  coarse gel structure, as evidenced by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
  These profound structural alterations underpinned the enhancement of water-holding
  capacity (WHC) and gel hardness in SPI/Car gels. These findings hold promise for
  the rational design and application of SPI-based systems in the production of processed
  vegetarian and vegan foods.
