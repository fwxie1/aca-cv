 abstract = {Background A range of bio-based, biodegradable, and edible straw options have emerged as eco-friendly alternatives to combat plastic straw pollution. These innovative solutions utilize materials such as polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose, and seaweed) and polylactic acid (PLA). Despite their positive environmental impact, these alternatives face challenges and limitations compared to traditional, durable plastic straws. Consequently, extensive research is underway to bolster their performance and refine manufacturing technology. Scope and approach This comprehensive review delves into recent strides in bio-based biodegradable straw development. It covers the spectrum from raw materials to manufacturing methods, including rolling-up, screw extrusion, directional diffusion assembly, and drill method. The exploration extends to targeted enhancement techniques, such as the creation of fiber composites and the development of hydrophobic coatings or surfaces. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the challenges faced by biodegradable straws, touching on nanotoxicity, raw material sourcing, cost, and degradation efficiency, adds depth to the analysis. Key findings and conclusions While existing processing methods cater to the preparation of biomass straws, a pressing concern is the lack of comprehensive and standardized evaluation criteria for biodegradability/composability. This gap contributes to confusion in assessing these alternatives. Addressing this issue emerges as a crucial step forward. This review emphasizes that breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies will heighten the market competitiveness of various biodegradable straw types. The conclusive insights and perspectives offer the aim to steer the design and fabrication of eco-friendly food tableware and packaging.},
