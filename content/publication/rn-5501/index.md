abstract: Background A range of bio-based, biodegradable, and edible straw options
  have emerged as eco-friendly alternatives to combat plastic straw pollution. These
  innovative solutions utilize materials such as polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose,
  and seaweed) and polylactic acid (PLA). Despite their positive environmental impact,
  these alternatives face challenges and limitations compared to traditional, durable
  plastic straws. Consequently, extensive research is underway to bolster their performance
  and refine manufacturing technology. Scope and approach This comprehensive review
  delves into recent strides in bio-based biodegradable straw development. It covers
  the spectrum from raw materials to manufacturing methods, including rolling-up,
  screw extrusion, directional diffusion assembly, and drill method. The exploration
  extends to targeted enhancement techniques, such as the creation of fiber composites
  and the development of hydrophobic coatings or surfaces. Additionally, a detailed
  discussion on the challenges faced by biodegradable straws, touching on nanotoxicity,
  raw material sourcing, cost, and degradation efficiency, adds depth to the analysis.
  Key findings and conclusions While existing processing methods cater to the preparation
  of biomass straws, a pressing concern is the lack of comprehensive and standardized
  evaluation criteria for biodegradability/composability. This gap contributes to
  confusion in assessing these alternatives. Addressing this issue emerges as a crucial
  step forward. This review emphasizes that breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies
  will heighten the market competitiveness of various biodegradable straw types. The
  conclusive insights and perspectives offer the aim to steer the design and fabrication
  of eco-friendly food tableware and packaging.
