abstract: While individual starch types may not possess the ideal gelatinization and
  retrogradation properties for specific applications, the amalgamation of multiple
  starch varieties might bestow desirable physicochemical properties upon resulting
  starch-based products. This study explored the impact of incorporating purple rice
  starch (PRS), as a novel starch variant (up to 15 % PRS), on the gelatinization
  and retrogradation (within 14 days) of regular wheat starch (WS). Rheological and
  texture assessments demonstrated that the introduction of PRS diminished the viscoelasticity
  and hardness of fresh WS paste. Additionally, in the case of retrograded WS pastes
  stored at 4 °C for 1–14 days, the incorporation of 10 % or 15 % PRS effectively
  retarded the reduction in transparency and significantly reduced hardness, retrogradation
  degree, the ratio of absorbance at 1047/1017 cm−1, and relative crystallinity. Notably,
  10 % PRS results in a more pronounced effect. Conversely, 5 % PRS induced an opposing
  impact on retrograded WS post-storage. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy revealed
  that as the proportion of PRS increased, the microstructure of gelatinized WS-PRS
  closely resembled that of pure PRS. In conclusion, the diverse effects of varying
  PRS proportions on WS alter the texture and characteristics of starch-based foods,
  underscoring the potential of starch blending for improved applications.
