abstract: While high-amylose starch (HAS) possesses advantageous properties such as
  high resistant starch content and favorable mechanical attributes, its gelatinization
  constraints have limited its applicability. This study enhances its versatility
  by focusing on pre-gelatinized (PG) HAS with exceptional rehydratability, achieved
  by disorganizing native HAS granules (with amylose contents of 55 % and 68 %, respectively)
  using a 33 % CaCl2 solution, followed by water-ethanol precipitation and freeze-drying.
  The resulting PG-HAS exhibited elevated amylose content (61 % and 75 %) with minimal
  changes in amylose molecular weight. PG-HAS displayed superior water-absorption
  index (WAI) and water-soluble index (WSI) compared to native HAS, further improved
  by 2 % CaCl2 solution incorporation. Furthermore, composite films were prepared
  by mixing PG-HAS with PVA at a 6:4 (w/w) ratio. The PG-G50 (61 % amylose content)/PVA
  composite film exhibited remarkable elongation (131.1 ± 5.4 %), nearly three times
  that of a normal corn starch (NCS, with 27 % amylose)/PVA film, attributed to improved
  starch dispersity and higher amylose content. Nonetheless, the PG-G70 (75 % amylose
  content)/PVA film at the same ratio showed lower elongation (54.7 ± 8.0 %), potentially
  due to strong cohesive forces between amylose chains that impede starch-PVA interactions.
  Moreover, the PG-HAS/PVA composite films, enriched with antibacterial agents, demonstrated
  effective antibacterial properties with a gradual and sustained release of active
  compounds. Notably, the PG-G50/PVA/tannic acid (TA) film effectively preserved fresh
  apple slices by inhibiting bacteria growth and preventing browning. These findings
  underscore the excellent rehydration of PG-HAS and its potential as an inner packaging
  material for irregularly shaped foods, such as sliced fruits or meats, due to its
  nontoxic nature, softness and flexibility, which allows the film to maintain close
  contact with food surfaces.
