abstract: This investigation stems from the wide interest in mitigating starch retrogradation,
  which profoundly impacts the quality of starch-based food, garnering significant
  attention in the contemporary food industry. Our study delves into the intricate
  dynamics of soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) and soybean oil (SO) when added
  individually or in combination to native corn starch (NCS), offering insights into
  the gelatinization and retrogradation phenomena. We observed that SSPS (0.5 %, w/w)
  hindered starch swelling, leading to an elevated gelatinization enthalpy change
  (∆H) value, while SO (0.5 %, w/w) increased ∆H due to its hydrophobicity. Adding
  SSPS and/or SO concurrently reduced the viscosity and storage modulus (G′) of starch
  matrix. For the starch gel (8 %, w/v) after refrigeration, SSPS magnified water-holding
  capacity (WHC) and decreased hardness through hydrogen bonding with starch, while
  SO increased hardness with limited water retention. Crucially, the combination of
  SSPS and SO maximized WHC, minimized hardness, and significantly inhibited starch
  retrogradation. The specific ratio of SSPS to SO was found to significantly influence
  the starch properties, with a 1:1 ratio resulting in the most desirable quality
  for application in starch-based foods. This study offers insights for utilizing
  polysaccharides and lipids in starch-based food products to extend shelf life.
