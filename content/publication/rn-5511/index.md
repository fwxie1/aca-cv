abstract: Polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels are widely used in wide-ranging applications
  in biology, medicine, pharmaceuticals and environmental sectors. However, achieving
  the requisite mechanical properties, fatigue resistance, self-recovery, biocompatibility,
  and biodegradability remains a challenge. Herein, we present a facile method to
  construct a nanocomposite hydrogel by integrating short linear glucan (SLG), obtained
  by debranching waxy corn starch, into a PAM network through self-assembly. The resulting
  composite hydrogel with 10 % SLG content exhibited satisfactory stretchability (withstanding
  over 1200 % strain), along with maximum compressive and shear strengths of about
  490 kPa and 39 kPa at 90 % deformation, respectively. The hydrogel demonstrated
  remarkable resilience and could endure repeated compression and stretching. Notably,
  the nanocomposite hydrogel with 10 % SLG content exhibited full stress recovery
  at 90 % compression deformation after 20 s, without requiring specific environmental
  conditions, achieving an energy dissipation recovery rate of 98 %. Meanwhile, these
  hydrogels exhibited strong adhesion to various soft and hard substrates, including
  skin, glasses and metals. Furthermore, they maintain solid integrity at both 37 °C
  and 50 °C after swelling equilibrium, unlike traditional PAM hydrogels, which exhibited
  softening under similar conditions. We hope that this PAM-SLG hydrogel will open
  up new avenues for the development of multifunctional electronic devices, offering
  enhanced performance and versatility.
