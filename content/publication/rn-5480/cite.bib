 abstract = {In pursuit of advancing the understanding of composite gel systems, this study delves into the intricate realm of rheology, structural elucidation, and mechanical attributes. Specifically, it scrutinizes the symbiotic interplay between rice starch, a cooling-set gel, and curdlan, a thermo-irreversible heating-set gel. A higher curdlan content enhances the inter-chain hydrogen bonding between rice starch and curdlan, resulting in a denser gel structure and thus increased moduli, solid-like behavior, and mechanical properties, and reduced frequency-dependence, especially at high temperatures (>65 °C). For example, with 50 % curdlan incorporation, G′ (90 °C) improved by 252 %. Notably, thermal treatment can compromise the structural integrity of the rice starch gel, reducing strength and softening texture. However, this textural degradation can be effectively mitigated with, for example, 30 % curdlan incorporation, resulting in a 55-fold hardness increase at 85 °C. The knowledge gained from this work offers valuable guidance for tailoring starch-based gel products to specific properties.},
