abstract: In pursuit of advancing the understanding of composite gel systems, this
  study delves into the intricate realm of rheology, structural elucidation, and mechanical
  attributes. Specifically, it scrutinizes the symbiotic interplay between rice starch,
  a cooling-set gel, and curdlan, a thermo-irreversible heating-set gel. A higher
  curdlan content enhances the inter-chain hydrogen bonding between rice starch and
  curdlan, resulting in a denser gel structure and thus increased moduli, solid-like
  behavior, and mechanical properties, and reduced frequency-dependence, especially
  at high temperatures (>65 °C). For example, with 50 % curdlan incorporation, G′
  (90 °C) improved by 252 %. Notably, thermal treatment can compromise the structural
  integrity of the rice starch gel, reducing strength and softening texture. However,
  this textural degradation can be effectively mitigated with, for example, 30 % curdlan
  incorporation, resulting in a 55-fold hardness increase at 85 °C. The knowledge
  gained from this work offers valuable guidance for tailoring starch-based gel products
  to specific properties.
