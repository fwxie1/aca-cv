abstract: Understanding the intricate relationships between the fine structure of
  xanthan on the assembly of konjac glucomannan (KGM) and xanthan is crucial for developing
  KGM/xanthan synergistic interaction gels. A combination of micro-differential scanning
  calorimetry, rheometry and atomic force microscopy were employed to explore the
  assembly process of KGM and xanthan with varying fine structures. Xanthan possessing
  standard acetyl (4.57%) and high pyruvate group contents (6.49%)(SA/HP) exhibited
  type-A and type-B bindings when interacting with KGM through cooling process. Decreasing
  these group contents effectively reduced type-B binding. Additionally, removal of
  pyruvate groups to 5.53% amplified type-A binding and gel strength from 258 Pa to
  653 Pa, thanks to the improved helical structure forming ability of xanthan. Decreasing
  acetyl groups also intensified type-A interaction and gel strength from 258 Pa to
  872 Pa. This stemmed from the formation of more stable assembly structure of xanthan
  and KGM, compared to the helical structure of deacetylated xanthan. These findings
  hold promise for the rational design of KGM/xanthan systems for versatile applications.
