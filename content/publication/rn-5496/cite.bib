 abstract = {In response to the burgeoning interest in the development of highly conformable and resilient flexible electronic sensors capable of transducing diverse physical stimuli, this review investigates the pivotal role of natural polymers, specifically those derived from starch, in crafting sustainable and biocompatible sensing materials. Expounding on cutting-edge research, the exploration delves into innovative strategies employed to leverage the distinctive attributes of starch in conjunction with other polymers for the fabrication of advanced sensors. The comprehensive discussion encompasses a spectrum of starch-based materials, spanning all-starch-based gels to starch-based soft composites, meticulously scrutinizing their applications in constructing resistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric sensors. These intricately designed sensors exhibit proficiency in detecting an array of stimuli, including strain, temperature, humidity, liquids, and enzymes, thereby playing a pivotal role in the continuous and non-invasive monitoring of human body motions, physiological signals, and environmental conditions. The review highlights the intricate interplay between material properties, sensor design, and sensing performance, emphasizing the unique advantages conferred by starch-based materials, such as self-adhesiveness, self-healability, and re-processibility facilitated by dynamic bonding. In conclusion, the paper outlines current challenges and future research opportunities in this evolving field, offering valuable insights for prospective investigations.},
