abstract: 'To comprehend the intricate interplay of five common food polysaccharides,
  κ-Carrageenan (KC), konjac glucomannan (KGM), locust bean gum (LBG), low-acyl gellan
  gum (LAG), and sodium alginate (SA), within composite polysaccharide gels, widely
  employed for textural modulation and flavor enhancement. This study systematically
  modulates the quantities of these five polysaccharides to yield six distinct multi-polysaccharide
  gels. The unique impact of each polysaccharide on the overall quality of composite
  gels were studied by thermostability, microstructure, water-holding capacity (WHC),
  texture, and sensory attributes. The findings unequivocally manifest the phenomenon
  of thermoreversible gelation in all composite gels, except for the KC-devoid sample,
  which displayed an inability to solidify. Notably, KGM, LBG, and LAG emerged as
  pivotal enhancers of the network structure in these composite gels, while SA was
  identified as a promotor of layered structure, resulting in a reduction of surface
  hardness. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA) to analyzed 14 critical
  evaluation parameters of the five multi-polysaccharide gels, revealing the order
  as follows: KC > KGM > SA > LAG > LBG. These findings would imparts valuable insights
  into the pragmatic utilization of multi-polysaccharide gels for the development
  of food products (e.g. Bobo balls in milk tea) with tailored textural and sensory
  attributes.'
