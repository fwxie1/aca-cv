 abstract = {To comprehend the intricate interplay of five common food polysaccharides, κ-Carrageenan (KC), konjac glucomannan (KGM), locust bean gum (LBG), low-acyl gellan gum (LAG), and sodium alginate (SA), within composite polysaccharide gels, widely employed for textural modulation and flavor enhancement. This study systematically modulates the quantities of these five polysaccharides to yield six distinct multi-polysaccharide gels. The unique impact of each polysaccharide on the overall quality of composite gels were studied by thermostability, microstructure, water-holding capacity (WHC), texture, and sensory attributes. The findings unequivocally manifest the phenomenon of thermoreversible gelation in all composite gels, except for the KC-devoid sample, which displayed an inability to solidify. Notably, KGM, LBG, and LAG emerged as pivotal enhancers of the network structure in these composite gels, while SA was identified as a promotor of layered structure, resulting in a reduction of surface hardness. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA) to analyzed 14 critical evaluation parameters of the five multi-polysaccharide gels, revealing the order as follows: KC > KGM > SA > LAG > LBG. These findings would imparts valuable insights into the pragmatic utilization of multi-polysaccharide gels for the development of food products (e.g. Bobo balls in milk tea) with tailored textural and sensory attributes.},
