abstract: Hydroxypropyl starch-based composite system has high potential for many
  applications such as food packaging and biomedical fields. Here, how the incorporation
  of curdlan, a thermo-irreversible heating-set gel, tailors the processability, structure,
  and film performance of hydroxypropyl starch, a cooling-set gel, has been systematically
  investigated, aiming to achieve enhanced material properties favorable for edible
  packaging applications. Curdlan incorporation increased the shear-thinning behavior
  and viscosity of hydroxypropyl starch solution, which was also strongly affected
  by temperature. The miscibility and comparability between the two polymers with
  distinct gelation behaviors is a practical and interesting scientific topic. Scanning
  electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis
  all indicated good compatibility between hydroxypropyl starch and curdlan. There
  was no observable phase boundary between the two materials, and all composite films
  showed only a single relaxation peak and only one polymer thermal decomposition
  peak. This resulted in improved structural density and overall performance. Compared
  with pure HPS film, the 7:3 HPS/CD film showed increases in tensile strength by
  66.12 % and thermal decomposition temperature by 3 °C, and a reduction in water
  solubility by 11.72 %. This knowledge gained here may facilitate the development
  of edible films based on hydroxypropyl starch with satisfying film performance and
  processability.
