 abstract = {Hydroxypropyl starch-based composite system has high potential for many applications such as food packaging and biomedical fields. Here, how the incorporation of curdlan, a thermo-irreversible heating-set gel, tailors the processability, structure, and film performance of hydroxypropyl starch, a cooling-set gel, has been systematically investigated, aiming to achieve enhanced material properties favorable for edible packaging applications. Curdlan incorporation increased the shear-thinning behavior and viscosity of hydroxypropyl starch solution, which was also strongly affected by temperature. The miscibility and comparability between the two polymers with distinct gelation behaviors is a practical and interesting scientific topic. Scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis all indicated good compatibility between hydroxypropyl starch and curdlan. There was no observable phase boundary between the two materials, and all composite films showed only a single relaxation peak and only one polymer thermal decomposition peak. This resulted in improved structural density and overall performance. Compared with pure HPS film, the 7:3 HPS/CD film showed increases in tensile strength by 66.12 % and thermal decomposition temperature by 3 °C, and a reduction in water solubility by 11.72 %. This knowledge gained here may facilitate the development of edible films based on hydroxypropyl starch with satisfying film performance and processability.},
