abstract: Abstract The inclusion of tungsten disulphide nanotubes (WS2 NTs) in chitosan,
  plasticized with glycerol, facilitates the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex.
  The glycerol interrupts the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between chitosan chains
  allowing positively charged protonated amines of chitosan to form a complex with
  negatively charged oxygen ions chemisorbed to the tungsten atoms in defects. These
  interactions, with the unique mechanical and chemical properties of WS2 NTs, result
  in a chitosan film with superior properties relative to unfilled chitosan. Even
  at low WS2 NT loadings (≤1 wt%), the Young's modulus (E) increases by 59%, tensile
  strength (σ) by 40% and tensile toughness by 74%, compared to neat chitosan, without
  sacrificing ductility. Addition of highly dispersed WS2 NTs significantly improves
  the gas barrier properties of chitosan, with a 50% reduction in oxygen permeability,
  while the addition of both glycerol and WS2 NTs to chitosan effectively reduces
  the carbon dioxide permeability by 80% and the water vapor transmission rate by
  90%. The intrinsic antimicrobial efficacy of chitosan against both Gram-positive
  and Gram-negative bacteria is enhanced on inclusion of WS2 NTs. Polyelectrolyte
  complexation of WS2 NTs and glycerol-plasticized chitosan provides a cost-effective,
  sustainable route to biodegradable films with desirable mechanical, gas barrier
  properties, and antimicrobial efficacy suitable for food packaging applications.
